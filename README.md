## 🎯 **Mission Statement**

Every year, countless Indian students suffer in silence—facing academic pressure, mental health crises, ragging, corruption, and injustice. Many feel they have no voice, no safe space to speak up. **SafeVoice changes that.**

We believe:
- **Every voice matters** - Your story deserves to be heard
- **Every life matters** - No student should suffer alone
- **Anonymity enables truth** - Real change starts with honest conversations
- **Community heals** - Together, we are stronger
